Brief description of the Bootstrap styling 

 

I attached the work that I have done for project Milestone 2 and milestone 3 with bootstrap applied to it. 

Bootstrap contains CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for topography, forms, buttons, navigation, drop-down menus, media objects and image classes, and other interface components. The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.  Bootstrap provisions for light colored tables, page headings, and text with a highlight.  

 

My bootstrap contains the JavaScript-based design in the html forms (index.html, signup.html, songs.html, success.html) 

 

My bootstrap contains the CSS based design 

 

Bootstrap contains jQuery.
