Brief description of the Bootstrap styling 

 

I attached the work that I have done for project Milestone 2 and milestone 3 with bootstrap applied to it. 

For Milestone 2(Task1): Bootstrap is applied to the file “lovelypage” that contains the pages of milestone2. 

Bootstrap contains CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for topography, forms, buttons, navigation, drop-down menus, media objects and image classes, and other interface components. The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.  Bootstrap provisions for light colored tables, page headings, and text with a highlight.  

 

My bootstrap contains the JavaScript-based design in the html forms (index.html, signup.html, songs.html, success.html) used in milestone2(lovelypage/templates/...) 

 

My bootstrap contains the CSS based design used in milestone2(lovelypage/static/css/bootstrap.min.css/) in addition to java script-based(lovelypage/static/js/bootstap.min.js/).  

 

Bootstrap.min.css contains the CSS necessary for the Bootstrap to work correctly. Bootstrap.min.js contains javascript code necessary for running Bootstrap.  

 

 

 		All javascript components of boostrap are bundled into bootstrap.min.js 

 

 

 

For Milestone 3(Task2): Bootstrap is applied to the file “my-app” that contains the pages of milestone3. 

 

Imported Bootstrap as a dependency. Installed Bootstrap as a dependency: npm install bootstrap 

Once the bootstrap is installed, it is then included in the app’s entry JavaScript file i.e src/index.js 

Install jquery and popper.js : npm install jquery popper.js 

Then, used the built-in Bootstrap classes in my React app components(built a new file called themeswitcher).
